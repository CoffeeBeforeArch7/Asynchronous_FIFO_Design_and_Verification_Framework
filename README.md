# Asynchronous FIFO

---



The Asynchronous FIFO Design and Verification Framework is a comprehensive implementation of a reliable cross-clock-domain data transfer solution. This project encompasses both RTL design and a complete verification environment. The FIFO implementation features Gray-coded pointers for robust clock domain crossing, parameterized width and depth settings, and configurable almost-full/empty flags.

The verification framework incorporates:

- SystemVerilog testbench

- Comprehensive test scenarios covering corner cases

- Functional coverage collection and monitoring

- Assertion-based verification for protocol compliance

- CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) analysis

- Performance metrics collection and analysis
